## Overview

The NestJS Monolithic Template is a comprehensive, production-ready starter template designed to accelerate backend development with NestJS. This template provides a solid foundation for building scalable, maintainable, and well-structured applications by incorporating industry best practices, common architectural patterns, and essential features out of the box.

## Key Features

- **Authentication & Authorization**: JWT-based authentication with role-based access control (RBAC)
- **Database Integration**: TypeORM integration with support for multiple databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite)
- **API Documentation**: Swagger/OpenAPI integration for automatic API documentation
- **Validation**: Comprehensive input validation using class-validator and class-transformer
- **Error Handling**: Centralized error handling with custom exception filters
- **Logging**: Structured logging with Winston and request/response logging
- **Testing**: Jest testing setup with e2e and unit test examples
- **Environment Configuration**: Environment-based configuration management
- **Security**: Helmet, CORS, rate limiting, and other security middleware
- **Docker Support**: Docker and Docker Compose configuration for easy deployment

## Architecture

The template follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

- **Modules**: Feature-based modules with controllers, services, and entities
- **Guards**: Authentication and authorization guards
- **Interceptors**: Request/response transformation and logging
- **Filters**: Global exception handling
- **Pipes**: Input validation and transformation
- **Middleware**: Security and utility middleware

## Technologies Used

- **NestJS** - Progressive Node.js framework for building scalable applications
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe JavaScript for better development experience
- **TypeORM** - Object-Relational Mapping for database operations
- **JWT** - JSON Web Tokens for authentication
- **Swagger** - API documentation and testing
- **Jest** - Testing framework

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Configure environment variables
4. Start local server: `npm run start:local`

## Benefits

- **Rapid Development**: Start building features immediately without boilerplate setup
- **Best Practices**: Follows NestJS and industry best practices
- **Scalable**: Modular architecture supports growth and team collaboration
- **Production Ready**: Includes security, logging, and monitoring features
- **Well Documented**: Comprehensive documentation and examples
- **Extensible**: Easy to customize and extend for specific requirements

## Use Cases

This template is ideal for:
- Building RESTful APIs and microservices
- Creating backend services for web and mobile applications
- Developing enterprise applications with complex business logic
- Learning NestJS best practices and patterns
- Prototyping and MVP development

The template serves as a solid foundation for any NestJS project, reducing development time and ensuring code quality from the start.
