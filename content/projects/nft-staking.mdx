## Overview
nft-staking is a decentralized platform where users can buy, mint, and stake NFTs. The marketplace features pre-uploaded graphic NFTs (Shroomies) on IPFS and randomly minted Heroes with varying rarities. Staked Heroes earn rewards, and both Shroomies and Heroes have their own marketplace. All contracts are deployed on Binance Smart Chain by default.

## Features
- Buy and sell Shroomies (graphic NFTs hosted on IPFS)
- Mint Heroes with random rarity
- Stake Heroes to earn rewards
- Dedicated marketplace for both NFT types
- Contracts deployed on Binance Smart Chain (BSC)
- Open source and customizable

## Technologies Used
- **Solidity** for smart contract development
- **Binance Smart Chain (BSC)** as the deployment network
- **ERC721** for NFT standards
- **IPFS** for decentralized NFT asset storage
- **React** and **TypeScript** for the frontend
