## Overview

MyMetaFi is a revolutionary web application that enables collective investment in the NFT and digital asset space. Users can join collectives, contribute funds towards shared goals, and participate in democratic decision-making for asset purchases. Once a collective reaches its funding goal, members can vote on proposals to purchase NFTs from OpenSea or other marketplaces. When assets are sold, profits are automatically distributed among collective members based on their contribution percentages.

## Motivation

MyMetaFi addresses the growing need for accessible and democratic investment opportunities in the NFT space. By enabling collective ownership and governance, the platform lowers barriers to entry for individual investors while providing the benefits of shared decision-making and risk distribution. The automated profit distribution system ensures fair and transparent returns, while the proposal-based governance model empowers users to actively participate in investment decisions.

The platform democratizes access to high-value NFTs and digital assets that might be out of reach for individual investors, while also fostering community-driven investment strategies and collective learning in the rapidly evolving digital asset ecosystem.
