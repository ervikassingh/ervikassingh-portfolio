## Overview

taxicoin.app is a cross-platform mobile application (iOS & Android) that revolutionizes the way users book and pay for taxi rides. Leveraging blockchain technology, the app enables seamless payments using the native TXC token and popular stablecoins. Users can also stake their TXC or stablecoins within the app to earn attractive yields, making it more than just a ride-hailing solution - it's a gateway to decentralized finance (DeFi) for everyday transportation.

## Key Features

- **Crypto Payments:** Pay for taxi rides instantly using TXC tokens or stablecoins directly from your mobile wallet.
- **In-App Staking:** Stake TXC or supported stablecoins within the app to earn yield and grow your assets while you ride.
- **Secure & Fast Transactions:** Blockchain-powered payments ensure security, transparency, and near-instant settlement.
- **User-Friendly Booking:** Intuitive interface for booking rides, tracking drivers, and managing payment preferences.
- **Cross-Platform:** Available on both iOS and Android devices for maximum accessibility.

## Technologies Used

- **Native iOS (Swift)** and **Native Android (Kotlin)** for platform-specific mobile development
- **NestJS (TypeScript)** for a robust, scalable backend API
- **Solidity & Smart Contracts** for secure staking and payment logic
- **Ethers.js** for blockchain integration

## Motivation

The goal of taxicoin.app is to bridge the gap between decentralized finance and real-world utility. By enabling crypto payments and staking within a familiar ride-hailing experience, the app empowers users to leverage their digital assets for everyday needs while earning passive income. This approach not only modernizes taxi payments but also introduces more people to the benefits of blockchain technology.
